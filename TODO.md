# TODO: Fix FluidGlass Navbar

- [x] Update src/App.jsx: Pass custom navItems to FluidGlass with functional links (Home to #top, About to #about, Contact to GitHub)
- [x] Add id="about" to ProfileCard in src/App.jsx for smooth scrolling
- [x] Adjust NavItems positioning in src/components/FluidGlass.jsx (increase z to 15.2 for better visibility)
- [x] Test navbar functionality and positioning (App running on http://localhost:5176/, navbar now has functional links: Home scrolls to top, About to ProfileCard, Contact opens GitHub)
